Assemblage is a concept that I latched onto this semester. I found it useful in illuminating a variety of composing processes and situations. It also made a useful bridge between the material and cognitive realities of composing and literacy practices. It has been something that I have worked to continue to inhabit and embody throughout this reflection and ePortfolio. It has been a concept that has been useful to "retheorize writing, especially given the current interest in materiality and technology" (Yancey and McElroy 17). This terms has been woven throughout my readings and writings this semester, even influencing my current thoughts towards a speciality area and list. It has offered me a way of talking about, reflecting on, and discussing my own composing processes in a way that feels more "real."

I see assemblage functioning within all of the composition that I have selected. They all have a sense of being situated in some embodied practice, draw on multiple sources, and are more as a whole than the sum of their parts. My literacy artifact, the [Brewtoad Profile](/post/literacy-artifact/) is rather representative of an assemblage that also has a useful explicit intersection with with literacy. The profile is itself a collection of recipes and notes on the brewing, that require some level of knowledge to read and interpret, and draws upon a number of different places in its construction.

My composition from [Jody Shipka's workshop](/post/outside-artifact-2/) is an explicit assemblage, and "conceptualizing research and composing processes as heterogeneous, complexly layered rearrangements of humans and nonhumans" (Shipka 144). In this way, it ties together the class and the outside experiences through a moment of praxis. The artifact, and the workshop itself, serve to concretize many of the material and cognitive aspects of literacy, and the teaching of literacy, from the semester. Additionally, assemblage was a very explicit concept in my [third selection](/post/selection-3/) with the assembled multi-voiced blog post. While there is certainly a artificialness to this post, it does serve as a visible representation of how assemblage may work in digital and physical texts.
