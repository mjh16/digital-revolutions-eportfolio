If you post to instagram, but no-one sees it, does it count? What about if no-one likes it? How does it change? This is a series of questions that I have been repeating, a lot and with slight variations, over the last few weeks of teaching. The idea of circulation gets to much of how I understand and continue to work with texts, especially digital ones. This has much to do with how texts do work in the world. In returning to Rice, as we have every semester, I see circulation and rhetorical ecologies continuing to play vital roles in how I understand rhetoric emerging and functioning in the world.

In Henkin's, “new media connect physically separated parties with a shared temporal framework” (2), helps to illuminate how time is an important considering with how texts and technologies bridge [bodies and spaces](/reflection/bodies-and-space/). This notion that circulation of texts helps to make the world smaller is something explored in *Spreadable Media*, and which continues to have impacts on how, where, and why texts do work. Additionally, circulation was well illuminated in my, surprise, [circulation map of AirBnB](/post/selection-2/). This exploration of how an idea, or in this case place to stay, circulated within the app's ecosystem is important when attempting to use the app. A literacy of the experience, and the currencies of the app help to fix and understand what to do with a text.

I've also found that circulation, as highlighted above, is a useful framework for students and acts as a threshold concept in their own writing and composing.
