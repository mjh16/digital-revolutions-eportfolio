This section represents less of an overt discussion on the literature and through the class, but has informed my thinking. It is difficult for me to see technology and literacy as separated from people in time and space interacting with thing. This has much to do with Standage's theories of circulation, but it comes down to, for me, moments of interaction between people and their stuff, with the intention of having that stuff do something with/by/through/to other people. Thinking about digital technologies as embodied has helped me to see how they have allowed us to do things that were otherwise difficult or much slower.

A good example of this moving of space through literacy is my [circulation map](/post/selection-2/). I had focused on AirBnB, and the ways in which places to stay and information circulated as social capital. Bodies and space are rather explicit in the ways in which they are regulated within AirBnB, with ideas of reputation and accuracy being important currency in the circulation. I also see a connection here with how I use [my course website](/posts/outside-artifact-1) to regulate classroom activity. There is an expectation that there will be a material reaction/action from my students based on how the digital text is used, displayed, and manipulated in the class.

Bodies and space further help to illuminate notions of how people shape and are shaped by their technologies. This was clear in Jim Porter's own explorations of his experiences with texts. It is also illuminated in Yancey, Craig, Davis, and Spooner and how "the materiality of a text might be 'relevant' to the presentation and retrieval (interpretation) of that text" (13). We tend, it seems, to flatten literacy (broadly) into a purely cognitive action, but thinking about how people position themselves towards texts and technologies helps to see how literacy is a reciprocal act, and is affected by a variety of material, technological, cognitive, and other factors.
