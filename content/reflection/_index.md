## Thinking Through, With, and Alongside: Bodies, Texts, and Technololgies

In thinking through this semester in Digital Revolutions/Convergence Culture, I see technology and literacy engaged in systems of meaning through which people navigate space, time, and material. Technology and literacy offer ways of making meaning through these juxtopositions and shifts in perspective. I have seen myself thinking about how literacy shapes and is shaped by technology, and how actors/subjectivities/bodies align themselves with, alonside, and through the technologies that are used. I see 21st century literacies exist within a continuum of technologies-actors-materials where literacies exist within that framework navigating, creating, consuming, and making meaning.

To structure this reflection, Iâ€™m doing things a bit differently, organizing around keywords and thinking about how those exist within the technology/literacy system itself. The [first section] (/reflection/technology-and-literacy) will focus on technology and literacy as a whole, starting from my notecard, and working through my learning and understanding. It serves as the broader frame for the assemblage, and is intended to act as an anchor point for the framework. There are then individual pages for the keywords [assemblage](/reflection/assemblage/), [bodies-and-space](/reflection/bodies-and-space), [circulation](/reflection/circulation/), and [memory](/reflection/memory). Each one of these is an exploration into why that is a keyword for me, what it adds to my knowledge, and works to illuminate how it operates within the broader whole. They aren't meant to be exhaustive, but to offer a synthesis of my thinking right now.

Each section will link to artifacts and discuss relevant learning and scholarship. The intention is to have the subsequent sections be read in any order, and add to the whole of the assembled piece. The main page of the reflection will work with the technology and literacy relationship, highlighting the role of the various parts, and having them linked. Each of the keywords will have its own subpage, reflecting on its relationship to the whole, and how they build some aspect of my understandings of 21st century literacy.
