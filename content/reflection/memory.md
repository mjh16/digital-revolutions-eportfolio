Memory is an idea that I feel emerged from my readings and work this semester. I didn't see it having an explicit exploration in the readings, but I do see it as an important component with how people interact with technology, what they hope it does, and their literacy experiences. I see traces of memory in Porter, with his discussions of technology and how it changed/changes, and in the ideas of *(re)Mediation*. The idea that new technologies are mediations of older technologies, that there is a thing-memory to the interfaces and experiences of mediation, is interesting and, while there was much that I found frustrating with Bolter and Grusin, remediation is a useful concept. I also saw the idea of memory through Gladwell, and how the materiality of paper, and the affordances of digital, offer different working memory spaces.

I see my own performance of this dual memory, working and storage (augmented?), through the [literacy artifact](/post/literacy-artifact/). This is a space to both remember what I have done in the past, draw on the memory of others, and to add to it myself. It serves as a recall and storage device, something that digital technologies are good at, in order to remake and revise recipes going forward. I also see the dual push/pull of paper and digital as I will often work with paper as I'm brewing, taking notes and measurements, and then return later to sort and transcribe them into the digital platform. It becomes a means by which memory functions in the assembled meanings of the pieces.
