I would like to start back at the beginning

### Notecard Front

This reflection feels like it just scratches the surface of this semester and what I have learned. This class, in many ways more-so than others, has felt more inquiry based and has often left me with newer question. In examining my evolving notions of literacy, I see that I continue to in notions of assemblage and uncertainty, and that dealing with composition, technology, and literacy will involve an open and questioning mind. There has been more unlocked and unexplored, many threads started that I want to continue to explore.

I’ve been most interested in how people/texts/technologies work with and through each other. There are threads of interest in how people know things through their technologies, and how those same technologies open and limit what is knowable. There is a give-and-take to technology ad literacy, where they both allow a person to see and not see within a system. Literacy has become a way in which people understand the material world, and technologies allow them to compose with these materials and share them with other people. This semester has helped to illuminate how these can be both hyper-visible and invisible at the same time. Technology can become an all-encompassing focus, or it can be one piece of understanding how and why people compose. With this understanding it becomes possible to see how "there is a creative or playful aspect to scholarship and most pedagogical practice" (Shipka 158) which can be meaningfully explored in those spaces.

I’ve also been interested in how people position themselves towards, with, along, and beside the technologies that they use and encounter. One of the themes that I most see emerging from my work this semester involve the overlapping, intersecting, and assembled relationships between social systems, activity systems, technological systems, and the different actors/actants within these spaces. The focus on digital revolutions and convergence, assemblage, remediation, and circulation help to show the back-and-forth realities to composing and literacy. I don’t see any one thing as being the driver of these systems, but find this multi-layered and inquiry based approach useful in teasing out and thinking about the interactions of technologies and literacies.

I’ve also found it interesting to think about how people think through and with tools and technologies, in the ways in which people play around with compositions as they work through and with their technologies. Thinking about how people position themselves towards composing and literacy, and how thinking about/with/through that can help us think about how to study and teach with technology. Technology certainly influences how and what we see, and how we respond. To treat it as a neutral medium is naïve at best and dangerous at worst. How we interact with the world is fundamentally changed by our technological uses, whether its graffiti or virtual reality. A literate person in the 21st century needs to know, and know how to approach, a broad range of technologies and views of the world, position themselves towards them, and be able to respond effectively.

This whole ePortfolio has felt like an excercise in assemblage, in bringing together multiple material and digital texts, experiences from throughout the semester, and multiple voices in an attempt to make sense of the learning and application from the semester. It also feels incredibly incomplete, raising more questions and routes of inquiry than coming to any sort of resolutions. The keywords that I have picked out--[assemblage](/reflection/assemblage/), [bodies and space](/reflection/bodies-and-space/), [circulation](/reflection/circulation/), and [memory](/reflection/memory/)--will continue to influence my thinking in various ways.
