### What?
*What is the artifact within the larger context of the course/experience?*

This is a collaborative share, done with Brendan, Lianna, and Kamilla, that represents our readings of assemblage theory. It came during the first part of our readings on assemblage. It also came during the week of Jody Shipka's visit and workshop for the rhetoric and composition program. To say that assemblage was on my mind would be an understatement. It also came within the same timeframe as the inclusion of a second artifact for the ePortfolio.

It also represented negotiating and navigating four different voices, which we did in a technicolor way. I found that while novel, that as a group we tended towards specialization in whatever the area is that we were working within, and didn't always make connections across and between ourselves and our readings. Three of us met at Lucky Goat to discuss approaching the post, and then proceeded to continue working within a shared Google Doc. This allowed us to work both talk through and plan out some of our response, and also gave a place for synchronous and asynchronous communication and composing online.

### So What?
*So what, or why was this a meaningful learning experience?*

This was meaningful both because of what worked and what didn't with the group. First, working with a group of four was a different sort of logistical and cognitive task. There was a need for a higher level of coordination and conversation between the different people. Because of this, it seemed like we came to consesus quickly, and spent more time at a high level within blog post itself. There was a great deal of timing and coordination necessary to navigate back and forth. I found my views shifting as we worked, and the task of composing together and alongside one another required constant shifting in the composing process.

On the one hand, it felt like it took us a while to come to consensus, with the final form for the post really only becoming apparent as we approached when it was due. The assemblage of voices, while interesting, didn't feel like it went as far as we could have gone with the post. It really did feel like an assemblage of various perspectives and voices, and as a whole it does something, but I feel like it could have done something more.

It was meaningful because assemblage theory clicked in a way for me, both within the context of this class, but also within broader rhetorical and compositional theories and frameworks that I'm working with. I also see my own working to negotiate between the texts and my peers in the collaboration, and that it demonstrates assemblage in very real and social ways.

### Now What?
*Now what, or what do I need to know or do for the learning that lies ahead?*

It first points to the highly collaborative, social, and material realities of composing and literacy practices. That time is an important aspect of composing and assemblage. It also lets me see how these interactions and ongoing discussions are important to the work of composing, literacy, and assemblage. It also offered a useful case study in thinking through how composing through assemblage works. It also gives me some useful things to think about for my own teaching, and in thinking through the collaborative nature of the final portfolio and projects.
