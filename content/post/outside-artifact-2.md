My second artifact is the composition that I created in Jody Shipka's workshop. While the images don't entirely do it justice, especially as it is something that I had inteded to be handled and manipulated, the images do give a sense of what it is and what it is doing.

### What?
*What is the artifact within the larger context of the course/experience?*

This artifact was the composition that I created during Jody Shipka's workshop on October 26th. The main canvas is a license plate with various components glued, draped, affixed, and adjacent to it. Overall, it was intended to materially convey as sense of place, movement, destruction, time, and conservation. I was successful in doing some of those based on reception.

### So What?
*So what, or why was this a meaningful learning experience?*

This was meaningful in how it embodied composition as situated and material practices. It helped to see the ways in which many of the other themes from this semester, especially assemblage, are seen and experienced. It was also a reminder that multimodal composing is more than just digital composing, and that there are important differences to the two. It was also a fun experience that connected well into the content of the class, really being able to concretize materiality, assemblage, audience, purpose, and constraints. It was an inhabitation and embodiment of genre in many ways.

### Now What?
*Now what, or what do I need to know or do for the learning that lies ahead?*

In addition to the what I've learned above, I see this experience and reflecting on it as continuing to inform my pedagogy. I've always been a visual/spatial thinker, who very much sees composition as a temporal and embodied practice, and the workshop helped to reinforce that. It also gave me some new vocabulary and approaches to use with students as I continue to work with them in various contexts.
