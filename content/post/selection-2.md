I did a thought experiment for the circulation of a hypothetical room share through airbnb. In doing so, I didn’t trace how a specific composition has circulated, but the ways in which the sharing economy of airbnb works through a variety of circulated information, actions, materials, and locations. I was also interested in how it has changed, and draws from, prior mediated forms of sharing and rental economies, imagining what it might look-like without the centralized authority and app to organize and coordinate the sharing. It also examines the flows of information and relationships across time, space, and events. The representation is credible in tracing the flows of reputation, space, people, and money as they interact with and between these spaces.

The key to this map is in tracing the plausible information flows from person to person, through the apps, and through the spaces for rent. I find the representations of the host “goods available” and guest “goods wanted” exchange a credible means of demonstrating and representing the two sides of the economic equation. Airbnb also reacts to market forces, using changes in supply and demand to examine pricing and other options. This represents the various personal and economic spaces that are represented. There is also an incentive to represent yourself well as both a host and as a guest. The information about each party helps those interested to make decisions about the exchange, and to agree that the terms seem fair and equitable.

An equally important aspect of the circulation within the map are the formal and informal social currencies associated with good hosting. There is also a clear sense within this circulation of being something different than a hotel or a more traditional Bed and Breakfast. At its core, airbnb claims to offer connections between people. The economic exchange is important, with prices, and types of locations available. There seems to be a convergence of different bodies, spaces, knowledges, and representations presenting in the app and in the experiences that the app represents.

I have learned that epistemology is something that is experientially exchanged within social systems. It can be done through first-hand accounts, such as leaving a review for a particularly good or bad experience, or can be circulated through social media—digitally in the reviews and other social media, or physically circulated around friend networks. There is a truth-telling claim for the reviews and representations, that the experience was accurate and would give a good indication of what someone else’s experience in that space and with those people would be like. There is an important exchange of accurate information, social approval, and economic exchanges. Behavior is also regulated, and treated as knowledge in the exchanges, with people gaining from curating positive responses from others.

I found that representing it visually and verbally helps me to think about the various ways in which the information, and different exchanges, circulated through the Airbnb system. It didn’t fundamentally change how I approached the task or what I did with the representation that I made as I tend to think in these ways to start with. I found in the tracing and imagining a convergence of social and economic economies. Social regulation and social capital are important areas of circulation. There is a need to experience the place to gain a reputation, and self-promotion through the social network becomes important. I also did decide to use Adobe Illustrator in the creation of my map, both to better learn the tools and because I thought it would offer the representation that I wanted. I did simplify based on my first idea based on what I found, and on other constraints.
