My first outside selection is the [course website that I developed for my ENC 2135 class this semeseter] (http://myweb.fsu.edu/mjh16m/enc2135-fall-2017/). This is a meaningful selection because of how it uses many of the tools, technologies, literacies, and discussions of this semester as a meaningful location for the course.

In framing my reflection on this piece, I'd like to turn to the same reflective questions as for the other

### What?
*What is the artifact within the larger context of the course/experience?*

This is the course website that I have designed and deployed for my ENC 2135 class this semester. I have previously used Wordpress for course websites, but this is the first time that I have largely deployed a website on my own in many years. I have used it as a central location for my students, updating examples and assignemnts there. It is also a working space, being used to post photo-notes, inclass prompts, workshop instructions, and activity instructions. They then remain on the site, searchable and accessible to students outside of the Canvas/Blackboard firewall. I've intentionally created it to both have more control, and to have it be a resource for the class. I see it connecting with many of the conversations that we've had about convergance in the class, and I see it connecting to the ideas of space, bodies, subjectivity, and technology that I've seen emerging as important for 21st century literacy.

### So What?
*So what, or why was this a meaningful learning experience?*

This is meaningful in a number of ways. The first is that I'm using a different open source system to create and upload the website. There are a number of reasons, but the largest has been my desire to better know how the tools and technologies that I use work. It is also something that provides me with a real sense of experiencing technology and literacy. I also chose it because of the connections that it makes between this class and composition, and helps to situate it within my broader interests and activities. I also used it as a moment to learn [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and the tool [Hugo](gohugo.io)

### Now What?
*Now what, or what do I need to know or do for the learning that lies ahead?*

Well, this website I feel was a really good first go using Hugo and hosting via FSU. It is something that I know I will continue to build forward, and see as being an important component to my upcoming courses, writing, and scholarship. It is something that I see as intersecting with many of my interests, and offering a place to explore technology and literacy. It is also something that I will continue to use and adapt in future contexts.
