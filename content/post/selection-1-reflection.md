### What?
*What is the artifact within the larger context of the course/experience?*

This selection is the SRR that I wrote on *The Social Life of Information*. It was originally due during Hurricane Irma, and it was a weird one in the ways in which it fit in this strange start to the semester. It was also a piece written when, while we were technically three weeks into the semester, we hadn’t met much yet.

### So What?
*So what, or why was this a meaningful learning experience?*

I chose this SRR for a few reasons. The first is that we haven’t written much yet in the class, and this is a piece that I feel was an interesting selection. It fell into an awkward place, where due to Labor Day, and then the hurricane, we hadn’t had any class time to really discuss things, or to establish much a baseline for the class. I found myself wrestling with this text, bring much of my own experiences to it as I thought through what they were doing and their perspectives. It did challenge me to thing about different and overlapping contexts for information, knowledge, tools, and technologies. I did find myself talking back at and to this book a lot, which means that I learned a lot from it.

### Now What?
*Now what, or what do I need to know or do for the learning that lies ahead?*

Looking at this artifact let’s me know that I’ll need to keep thinking on different levels and through different frames throughout this class. The content is stuff that I largely feel comfortable with, having grown up, used, and been around this stuff all of my life. There have been times where I’ve been much more international with it, such as now, and many others where it largely became transparent. It also lets me know that I’ll need to continue to be aware, and look for intersections between my experiences and these texts.
