### What?
*What is the artifact within the larger context of the course/experience?*
This artifact was the second major composing assignment that we had this semester. It also came due right after traveling to Feminisms and Rhetorics, so this context colored my experiences. The conversation between Jessi and I which lead to this topic was a good experience of using AirBnB for a trip to St. Augustine. This intersected with various discussions and uses of Uber and other sharing-economy apps.
Within the class, it came within the ongoing readings and discussions of circulation and remediation. We had finished reading, and were still hashing out, Bolter and Gruisin, and we had moved into *Writing on the Wall.* It also came just after my own working with Laurie Gries's *Still Life with Rhetoric* for my paper presentation. So, there was a great deal of thinking about how the material realities, remixes, changes, and implications of AirBnB as an experience, app, and interface. My initial ideas about this project were much larger, I think, than what I was able to do within the time and space that I had. So, there was a lot of *material* floating around in my head as I worked through this through experience.

### So What?
*So what, or why was this a meaningful learning experience?*
First, I ended up finding out more than I thought I would about the app simply by thinking about it. I also connected it to the idea of AirBnB as facilitating experiences between people, not just as a place to find a room to rent. I also saw this as an important way to think about informatio flows and how it builds knowledge of people and places. It takes some interesting steps to remediate the BnB experience, along with connecting information into useable and actionable knowledge between people. Second, it was useful to think about the material implications of circulation with the app, between people, and between physcial places. There are interesting social *AND* material circulations that comes with this convergence. I feel like I worked throught relationships that are idealized as presented, the role of gate-keeping, the importance of social capital, and the experiences of the app. And as a platform, none of these are independant, and the various instaces depend upon one another in many ways to function.
Additionally, I learned more about using Adobe Illustrator.

### Now What?
*Now what, or what do I need to know or do for the learning that lies ahead?*
It tells me to set reasonable boundaries, and that I need to continue working on how to articulate and translate my ideas into various composition. It also indicates that thinking about the material, cognitive, social, and digital components of circulation, assemblage, composing, and rhetoric are all important. There is a need to think both broadly about digital writing and teaching, while also offering places to go into depth, and of tracing out a multitude of potentialities and realities for a circulating composition.
