Welcome to my ePortfolio for the semester. Below you can find links to artifacts that I have included along with reflections upon their place within the class and this semester. An overall reflection, [Thinking Through, With, and Alongside: Bodies, Texts, and Technololgies] (/reflection/), links the learning and experiences of the semester together.
