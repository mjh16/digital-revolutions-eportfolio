I'm Michael Healy, and I am a 2nd year PhD student at Florida State University. I am interested in the overlaps between creative writing and composition, invention and creativitiy, and how people use, navigate, and are shaped by the digital tools and networks they encounter. I currently tutor in the [FSU Johnston Digital Studio] (https://wr.english.fsu.edu/johnston-digital-studio) and teach [ENC 2135] (http://myweb.fsu.edu/mjh16m/enc2135-fall-2017/). When I'm not teaching, studying, or writing, I enjoy cooking, baking bread, brewing beer, and running.
