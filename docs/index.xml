      <description>Below is a piece of born digital scholarship examining public memory, memorilization, and the circulation of artifacts from September 11th, including steel. Portions of the video do not have audio, which is intentional to allow room for making connections between the audio, video, and text.

      <title>Technology and Literacy: Two Perspectives on a System</title>

      <description>I would like to start back at the beginning
Notecard Front    The front of the notecard with definitions from the first day of class. The questions that guided each entery are: What does it mean to be literate? and Why and/or how is this important?   Notecard Back    These represent changing in my earlier definitions as prompted during different points in the semester.</description>

      <description>If you post to instagram, but no-one sees it, does it count? What about if no-one likes it? How does it change? This is a series of questions that I have been repeating, a lot and with slight variations, over the last few weeks of teaching. The idea of circulation gets to much of how I understand and continue to work with texts, especially digital ones. This has much to do with how texts do work in the world.</description>

      <description>Memory is an idea that I feel emerged from my readings and work this semester. I didn&amp;rsquo;t see it having an explicit exploration in the readings, but I do see it as an important component with how people interact with technology, what they hope it does, and their literacy experiences. I see traces of memory in Porter, with his discussions of technology and how it changed/changes, and in the ideas of (re)Mediation.</description>

      <description>This section represents less of an overt discussion on the literature and through the class, but has informed my thinking. It is difficult for me to see technology and literacy as separated from people in time and space interacting with thing. This has much to do with Standage&amp;rsquo;s theories of circulation, but it comes down to, for me, moments of interaction between people and their stuff, with the intention of having that stuff do something with/by/through/to other people.</description>

      <description>Assemblage is a concept that I latched onto this semester. I found it useful in illuminating a variety of composing processes and situations. It also made a useful bridge between the material and cognitive realities of composing and literacy practices. It has been something that I have worked to continue to inhabit and embody throughout this reflection and ePortfolio. It has been a concept that has been useful to &amp;ldquo;retheorize writing, especially given the current interest in materiality and technology&amp;rdquo; (Yancey and McElroy 17).</description>

      <description>My second artifact is the composition that I created in Jody Shipka&amp;rsquo;s workshop. While the images don&amp;rsquo;t entirely do it justice, especially as it is something that I had inteded to be handled and manipulated, the images do give a sense of what it is and what it is doing.

      <description>My first outside selection is the course website that I developed for my ENC 2135 class this semeseter. This is a meaningful selection because of how it uses many of the tools, technologies, literacies, and discussions of this semester as a meaningful location for the course.
In framing my reflection on this piece, I&amp;rsquo;d like to turn to the same reflective questions as for the other

      <title>Literacy Artifact Reflection</title>

      <description>The literacy artifact that I have chosen is my Brewtoad online homebrewing recipe and log book. I chose this artifact because I was unsure what I wanted to choose, and this seemed to have an overlap of a number of my interests and hobbies. I think that it also speaks to the rhetorical nature of literacy, and the ways in which it isn’t just a passive act or action, but something that has personal, material, ongoing, interactive, and social qualities.</description>

      <description>What? What is the artifact within the larger context of the course/experience?
This is a collaborative share, done with Brendan, Lianna, and Kamilla, that represents our readings of assemblage theory. It came during the first part of our readings on assemblage. It also came during the week of Jody Shipka&amp;rsquo;s visit and workshop for the rhetoric and composition program. To say that assemblage was on my mind would be an understatement.</description>

      <description>For this third selection, I chose a collaborative blog post on assemblage. The post can be found here, and I&amp;rsquo;ve copied the text of the post below, though the color of the fonts did not carry with it.
A reflection on this piece can be found here
Isn&amp;rsquo;t Assemblage All of the Things?: An assemblage by Kamila, Michael, Liana, and Brendan We could think of assemblage as a way of composing using “disparate elements” or the “use, reuse, and repurposing of materials” (Yancey and McElroy 4).</description>

      <description>What? What is the artifact within the larger context of the course/experience?
This artifact was the second major composing assignment that we had this semester. It also came due right after traveling to Feminisms and Rhetorics, so this context colored my experiences. The conversation between Jessi and I which lead to this topic was a good experience of using AirBnB for a trip to St. Augustine. This intersected with various discussions and uses of Uber and other sharing-economy apps.</description>

      <title>Selection 2: AirBnB Circulation Map</title>

      <description>I did a thought experiment for the circulation of a hypothetical room share through airbnb. In doing so, I didn’t trace how a specific composition has circulated, but the ways in which the sharing economy of airbnb works through a variety of circulated information, actions, materials, and locations. I was also interested in how it has changed, and draws from, prior mediated forms of sharing and rental economies, imagining what it might look-like without the centralized authority and app to organize and coordinate the sharing.</description>

      <description>What? What is the artifact within the larger context of the course/experience?
This selection is the SRR that I wrote on The Social Life of Information. It was originally due during Hurricane Irma, and it was a weird one in the ways in which it fit in this strange start to the semester. It was also a piece written when, while we were technically three weeks into the semester, we hadn’t met much yet.</description>

      <guid>http://michaelhealy.space/digital-revolutions-eportfolio/post/selection-1/</guid>
      <description>Selection 1: Thinking about Networks, Interfaces, and Open-Source In The Social Life of Information, Seely Brown and Duguid explore the expansion of information and information technologies, and the effects on the people, products, business, education, and lives of these involved. They largely focus on important business and industrial players, and the ways in which they had evolved during the late 1990s. They also look at the shifting economic and cultural forces, examining how formalized structures are slow to adapt to the changing realities.</description>
