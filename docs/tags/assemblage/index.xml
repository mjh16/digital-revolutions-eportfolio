      <description>Assemblage is a concept that I latched onto this semester. I found it useful in illuminating a variety of composing processes and situations. It also made a useful bridge between the material and cognitive realities of composing and literacy practices. It has been something that I have worked to continue to inhabit and embody throughout this reflection and ePortfolio.
