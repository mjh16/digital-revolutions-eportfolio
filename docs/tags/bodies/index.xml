      <description>This section represents less of an overt discussion on the literature and through the class, but has informed my thinking. It is difficult for me to see technology and literacy as separated from people in time and space interacting with thing. This has much to do with Standage&amp;rsquo;s theories of circulation, but it comes down to, for me, moments of interaction between people and their stuff, with the intention of having that stuff do something with/by/through/to other people.</description>
